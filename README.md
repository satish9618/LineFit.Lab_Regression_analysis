# LineFitLab: Streamlined Linear Regression Builder

## Overview
LineFitLab is a powerful, user-friendly web application built with **Streamlit** that simplifies the process of building and evaluating linear regression models. Designed for data scientists, analysts, and machine learning enthusiasts, it provides an interactive interface to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and compare multiple regression models with minimal coding. The application leverages industry-standard libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **numpy**, and **plotly** to deliver robust functionality, making it an ideal tool for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

This project showcases advanced data science techniques, including feature engineering, outlier detection, multicollinearity handling, and model evaluation, all wrapped in a sleek, professional interface. It is designed to streamline the machine learning workflow while ensuring transparency and interpretability of the modeling process.

## Features

### 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- **CSV File Upload**: Seamlessly upload datasets in CSV format for analysis.
- **Column Selection**: Interactively select and remove irrelevant columns to focus on meaningful features.
- **Target Variable Selection**: Easily designate the target variable for regression modeling.
- **Null and Duplicate Handling**: Automatically removes null values and duplicate rows to ensure clean data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Categorical Encoding**: Supports **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables, with user-configurable options for each column.
- **Outlier Detection**: Implements multiple outlier detection methods to ensure robust data preprocessing:
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Z-score
  - Modified Z-score
  - Cook's Distance
  - Leverage
  - Residuals
  - Mahalanobis Distance
  - Isolation Forest
- **Multicollinearity Removal**: Offers **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**-based feature selection to eliminate highly correlated features, improving model stability.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses **Plotly** to generate dynamic bar charts comparing R² scores across different outlier detection and multicollinearity removal methods.

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation
- **Automated Pipeline**: Constructs a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, encoding, outlier removal, and model training.
- **Pipeline Visualization**: Displays a visually appealing, step-by-step representation of the modeling pipeline using custom HTML/CSS styling.
- **Linear Regression**: Trains and evaluates a linear regression model with detailed performance metrics:
  - Training and Testing R² Scores
  - Training and Testing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- **Model Fit Assessment**: Automatically detects **overfitting** or **underfitting** by comparing training and testing R² scores, providing actionable insights.

### 4. Advanced Model Comparison
- **Multiple Regression Models**: Compares the performance of four regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Elastic Net
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays R² scores and RMSE for each model in a tabular format and visualizes results using interactive **Plotly** charts.
- **Best Model Selection**: Identifies the best-performing model based on R² score for optimal decision-making.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for an interactive web interface
- **Backend**: Python with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and scipy
- **Visualization**: Plotly for dynamic, interactive charts
- **Styling**: Custom HTML/CSS for professional pipeline visualization

## Why LineFitLab Stands Out
- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive interface that guides users through the entire machine learning workflow, from data upload to model comparison.
- **Comprehensive Preprocessing**: Handles all aspects of data preparation, including encoding, outlier detection, and multicollinearity, reducing manual effort.
- **Robust Evaluation**: Provides detailed performance metrics and visualizations to ensure transparency and interpretability.
- **Extensibility**: Modular code structure allows for easy integration of additional features or algorithms.
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean, well-documented code and a polished UI make it suitable for showcasing in portfolios or professional settings.
